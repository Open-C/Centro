![Centro Header](/client/assets/images/readme-header.png)

Centro is an Android, iOS, and web app that allows Celo users to easily access DeFi protocols and manage their assets. Centro has a simple and standardized user interface, making it easy for novices to engage with dapps on Celo.

Centro empowers users to safely and efficiently manage their assets across the Celo ecosystem while maintaining self-custody. Centro has free cash-in, cash-out, and trading, but we take a small percentage of interest earned on Moola deposits to fund new integrations.

## Who We Are
Darryl, Dylan, and Eric--the creators of Centro--are all students at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. We met through Blockchain at Cal Poly (student club) and SLOHacks (hackathon), where we developed a shared passion for decentralized finance. Our past blockchain projects range from savings circles to streamable payments, and we also made [CeloHub](https://celohub.org)--a dapp gallery for the Celo blockchain. Our team has a diverse skillset, and together we form OpenC. Darryl led front-end development with React Native, Dylan led backend architecture + smart contracts with Solidity, and Eric led product. 


## Our Make it Mobile Experience
Centro is part of the Celo Make it Mobile Hackathon with GitCoin.
